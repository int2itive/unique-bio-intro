  <h1>The Essence: Unlimited</h1>
      <p>Introverted Decisions reflects the spirit of a warrior, renowned resilience and the uniqueness of understanding self. Thus, creating the best version of self through a mechanism that is healthy.
</p>
      <p>Table of (dis)contents: a) moving away from Black music as mainly connected to orality or an exaggerated admiration of the voice b) dislike of 
focus on historical and biographical; instead focus more on parahistorical, ahistorical, analogical, anonymity and mythopoesis/fabulism c) 
ignorance of electronics d) over-evaluation of Hip-Hop (James Baldwin: the slightest shift in Negro identity, the stars would lose position) 
e) More emphasis on “unblack,” “unpopular,” and “unculture” and less on this idea of ghetto centricity to give more shine on unknown black 
      composers.</p>
      <p>You must recognize that consciousness is power; being aware, knowing something, and being able to do something is what consciousness is all about. This grants power. Remember, we act in terms of what we know, what we believe, what we expect, what we value, what skills we have. All of this is part of consciousness. Therefore, when you manipulate these things, you manipulate people’s ability.

      <p>2. People who can’t trust, can’t be trusted. People who are chronically insecure in their relationships are more likely to sabotage them. Call it the Good Will Hunting syndrome, but one way people protect themselves from getting hurt is by hurting others first</p>
      <p>18. The more convinced someone is that they’re right, the less they probably know. There’s a direct correlation between how open a person is to differing perspectives and how much that person actually knows about any given subject. Or as the philosopher Bertrand Russell once said: “The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.”</p>
      <p>5. The more something scares you, the more you should probably do it. With the exception of genuinely life-threatening or physically harmful activities, our fight-or-flight response kicks in when we’re confronted with past traumas or actualizing the self we dream of being. For instance: speaking to an attractive person, cold-calling someone to get a new job, public speaking, starting a business, saying something controversial, being painfully honest with somebody, etc., etc. These are all things that make you scared, and they make you scared because they are things that should be done.</p>
     <p>3. The more you try to impress people, the less impressed they’ll be. Nobody likes a try-hard.</p
